<h1>To do list üìù</h1>

<p>A simple and easy to use to do list web application that allows users to keep track of the current date, current tasks, and past tasks. Users can also sort their tasks by level of importance and view important tasks at the top and less important tasks at the bottom. Once users are done with all there tasks they can choose to take a break by trying out the random activity generator at the bottom of the web app.</p>

<p>This to do list was built using React for the UI, to render different components, and for state management. React Icons and CSS were used to style the UI. Local storage were used to store user current and past tasks. The bored API was used for the random activity generator at the bottom of the web app to encourage users to take some time for joy and leisure after doing work.</p>
